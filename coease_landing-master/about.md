## COEASE

Do you feel that you have symptoms of COVID-19? Do you feel the urge to get it tested, but it is too risky to get any tests done because of massive crowds at the hospitals? Unable to wait for days to get the blood test reports? Scared that you may get infected while waiting at the hospital to get your X-Ray tested? Fear not, get a quick X-Ray taken and upload it on Coease to get immediate results. While it takes doctors 10-15 minutes to give a diagnosis, Coease does it in less than a second. This app uses state of the art Machine Learning techniques to determine if you have chances of being infected with COVID-19. Not just COVID-19, this app will give detection results for Tuberculosis and Pneumonia as well. Stay tuned for an update with the detection and diagnosis of sixteen lung diseases. This app will also use the ‘Stay At Home’ feature that will make sure you all stay at home amid this crisis.

## NOTE

Do not panic if you have been tested positive for **COVID-19** by the X-Ray detector because the Machine Learning model may have received an unclear image or may have tested wrong (**Even though it is 97% accurate, there is still a 3% chance it may have gone wrong**). Make sure to call your nearest hospital or Government facility and request a thorough check-up. In case of any discrepancy, the doctor’s views and opinions are final and should be adhered to. We in no way challenge the intellect and knowledge of the doctors. In fact, we wish to assist them in reducing the huge crowds at the hospitals by providing estimated detection of these diseases. We salute our doctors for keeping us safe in these difficult times and merely wish to help them in this process.

**Stay Home Stay Safe**
