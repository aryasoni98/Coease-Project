  <h1>Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions:</h1>
		<p>
			This is a project done by 1st year students of NSUT, Delhi, on the basis of the data available at 
			<a href="https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset">
			(IEEE Dataset on COVID-19 images)</a> and <a href="https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC/folder/36938765345">
			(NIH Chest X-ray Dataset of 14 Common Thorax Disease Categories)</a>. Though the results as per the data provided 
			are accurate, they have not been vetted
			by any medical professional. The diseases may have new changes or patterns which cannot be accounted for by
			this application. The results are not certain, and this has been made for preventive measures to be taken by any
			person tested positive. The results are produced by a machine based on past trends and hence there is no
			guarantee that it will hold up in the future and test correctly under all circumstances because just like humans,
			even a machine cannot be absolutely correct about everything. We always believe that the machine under no
			situation can replace the diagnosis of medical professionals who have gained knowledge through years of practice.
			Our team would like to salute our medical professionals who work day and night to keep us safe and assist them in
			the process with this application. Please treat this as our classroom project and do not rely on it for precise
			medical results. Please consult the doctor before any reliance on the results provided by the application. The
			results of the application - whatever they are, must be verified by a doctor. The views and opinions of the doctor
			are final under any discrepancy. The creators of this application in no way challenge the intellect and knowledge
			of the doctors. By downloading this app you agree that the developers are bound to no legal obligations or
			complications and are in no way responsible for decisions taken by the reader based on the information
			provided in this app. Any interpretation made by the user is in no way a legal obligation against the developers
			of this app. The creators are in no way legally obligated under any circumstance to account for the result
			presented by the model. No information or photo uploaded on this app is shared or distributed by the
			developers of this app. We are not accountable for use of data by third party apps. Please refer the terms and
